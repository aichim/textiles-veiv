This is a fork of http://source.netsurf-browser.org/libsvgtiny.git

I forked from a while back when the library still depended on libxml2.
Since then the library moved on to "libdom" which makes the dependency
chain quite long and the libxml2 version works nice for my needs.

My primary changes are to the example app. It used to depend on X11 and
Cairo. I replaced calls to Cairo with simple stubs that print to stdout.
